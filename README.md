Design patterns in java

1. **Facade**: https://stackoverflow.com/a/64160519/4952262

2. **Template method**: The Template Method Pattern defines the skeleton
of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to
subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine
certain steps of an algorithm without changing the
algorithmâ€™s structure.

General receipe is in CaffeineBeverage while in Tea and Coffe extends this class and provide implementation for it's own methods. `boilWater` and `pourInCup` already have logic in abstract class while methods used strictly for tea/coffe are abstract so CaffeineBeverage doesn't know about implementation and tea/coffee classes provide logic for them.
