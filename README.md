Template method: The Template Method Pattern defi nes the skeleton
of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to
subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefi ne
certain steps of an algorithm without changing the
algorithmâ€™s structure.

General receipe is in CaffeineBeverage while in Tea and Coffe extends this class and provide implementation for it's own methods, `boilWater` and `pourInCup` already have logic in abstract class while methods used only for tea/coffe are abstract so CaffeineBeverage doesn't know about implementation.
